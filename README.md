# Platypus Platform: Tools for Scalable Software Deployment

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/square/p2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/square/p2)

This is a collection of tools intended to allow huge fleets of machines to participate in safe, flexible and scalable deployment models.

**This project is still under development and should not be used for anything in production yet. We are not seeking external contributors at this time**

# Playing Around

To build the tools in `pp`, run `rake build`. The `bin` subdirectory contains agents and executables, the `pkg` directory contains usefl libraries for Go. We strongly believe in small things that do one thing well.
